### Future Features
- RTL Support: Arabic Language
    - To make GluteniPedia accessible to a wider audience, we plan to introduce full Arabic language support, which includes implementing a Right-to-Left (RTL) layout for optimal readability. This change will allow us to cater to Arabic-speaking individuals and ensure that the website functions seamlessly in both languages, offering the same great experience regardless of the user’s language preference. This involves adapting the site’s design, text alignment, and navigation to properly support RTL content.
- Community for Users
    - We understand the importance of connecting with others who share similar experiences. Soon, we will introduce a dedicated community space where users can share their personal stories, tips, and experiences with gluten-free living. Additionally, users will be able to upload and exchange gluten-free recipes, creating a collaborative environment for sharing ideas and support.
- Gluten-Free Restaurants Section
    - Dining out can be challenging for those on a gluten-free diet, which is why we are planning to introduce a dedicated section featuring restaurants that offer gluten-free options. This feature will allow users to easily find and explore dining establishments that cater to their dietary needs, making eating out a more enjoyable and worry-free experience.
