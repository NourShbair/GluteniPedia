## Bugs
- Margins in celebrities page had some overlapping on real mobile devices.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-celebrity-margin-unsolved.jpeg)

    - To fix this, I cropped all celebrities pics to be square ratio (1:1)
    
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-celebrity-margin-solved.jpeg)

- Scrolling in side menu showning the content of the page on small and medium devices.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-menu-scroll-unsolved.png)

    - To fix this, I set 'fixed' value for 'position' attribute to the container div
    
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-menu-scroll-solved.png)


## Unfixed Bugs

- On medium devices (ipad and tablets), website name in slide menu should be lighter color (white).

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug-menu-site-name-color-unsolved.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to customize the color in tablets media query to handle this, but it did not solve the issue.

- Some divs have small margins and need to justify the margins for all pages.
